### CONTENTS
This folder contains the script we use to create bar charts for the UN. 

It includes:
- :page_facing_up: Sample data, so you can try it out with something that works first
- :bar_chart: An example of what the resulting plot should look like

----

#### Unfinished business
We've tried to script as much as possible of the styling in code, but there's some things we haven't managed yet.

Here's a list of the bits of styling left to do:
- Font (should be ...)
- Continue the horizontal gridlines underneath the y axis labels
- Adjust the distance of the country code labels from the x axis

If you think you can add these details in, please:
1. Create a branch and work on the update the script
2. Commit this to the master when you're ready
3. Update this README file

Thanks!
