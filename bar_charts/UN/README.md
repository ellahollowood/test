#### This folder contains the script we use to create bar charts for the UN. 
It includes:
- Sample data, so you can try it out with something that works first
- An example of what the resulting plot should look like

#### Styling
We've tried to script as much as possible of the styling in R code but there's some things we haven't managed yet.

The bits of styling left to do are:
- Font (should be ...)
- Continue the horizontal gridlines underneath the y axis labels
- Adjust the distance of the country code labels from the x axis

Please create a branch to update the script if you can find a way of getting this stuff done in code.

Thanks!
