#### This is a test repo for getting familiar with Github

# Some things to consider for the BW script templates repo

## 1. Folder structure :file_folder:
Files like so: script-templates/device_type_client_name/script.py

## 2. READMEs :clipboard:
More READMEs
README for each script, listing things like dependencies and describing the sample datasets?

## 3. Dependencies :white_check_mark:
How do we highlight things like needing to install packages (in the script, in a readme etc?)

See packrat for R:
- https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/
- https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/walkthrough.html

Find something similar for python? processing?

## 4. Data :chart_with_upwards_trend:
Because the repositories are public, we want fake data sets that show the structure of how the data should look.

## 5. Wikis :raising_hand:
We could have Wikis for useful code snippets (rather than whole scripts).

## 6. Overall README items
Things like, to use this repo, you need:
- R
- R Studio
- Python
- pip
- packrat works like this etc.

And contents page for easy searching of bar charts (don't need to use list)
